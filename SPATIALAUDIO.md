# Spatial Audio Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement spatial audio so players can hear each other's actions in 3D space.

## To-Do List

- [x] Fix Safari audio compatibility by adding MP3 alternatives for OGG files
- [x] Create remote player audio component to handle sounds from other players
- [x] Add audio mute controls to UI for testing with multiple browsers
- [x] Implement audio position sync via the network system
- [x] Add event system to trigger remote player sounds (footsteps, shots, etc.)
- [x] Fix gunshot sounds to respect audio mute settings
- [x] Fix remote player footsteps to correctly distinguish between walking/running
- [x] Fix remote player gunshots not being heard
- [x] Enhance sound propagation with improved volume and distance settings
- [x] Add debugging tools for audio events
- [ ] Add audio occlusion/obstruction for more realistic spatial audio
- [ ] Optimize audio performance with culling based on distance

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Create RemotePlayerAudio Component ✅
- [x] Create a new component for remote player audio handling
- [x] Add support for different audio types (footsteps, weapon sounds)
- [x] Implement 3D spatial positioning

### 2. Implement Audio Mute Controls ✅
- [x] Add mute button to main UI
- [x] Create global audio settings with mute option
- [x] Save mute preference to localStorage
- [x] Add individual volume controls for different sound categories
- [x] Fix weapon sounds to respect mute settings

### 3. Network System Integration ✅
- [x] Extend existing network events to include audio triggers
- [x] Send position data along with audio events
- [x] Add timestamp for proper synchronization
- [x] Improve remote player state detection (walking vs running)
- [x] Add unique IDs for shot events to prevent duplicates
- [ ] Implement latency compensation

### 4. Audio Event System ✅
- [x] Create event emitter/listener for audio events
- [x] Add distinct event types for different sounds
- [x] Implement throttling to prevent audio spam
- [x] Fix gun shot events to properly trigger audio
- [x] Improve error handling for audio playback
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms for audio that fails to play
- [ ] Add distance-based culling to save resources

### 5. Testing and Optimization
- [x] Test with Safari browser compatibility
- [x] Test audio mute controls for all sound types
- [x] Test cross-browser audio (Chrome → Safari, vice versa)
- [x] Fix walking sounds not playing with proper state detection
- [x] Fix gunshot sounds not playing reliably
- [ ] Test with multiple browsers simultaneously
- [ ] Measure performance impact
- [ ] Optimize buffer usage and audio loading
- [ ] Add audio pooling for frequently used sounds

### 6. Recent Fixes (2023-07-05)
- [x] Fixed running sounds playing incorrectly during walking
- [x] Fixed walking sounds not playing at all for remote players
- [x] Fixed gunshot sounds not being heard from other players
- [x] Increased sound volumes for better audibility at distance
- [x] Added better debugging tools for tracking audio events
- [x] Improved error handling for audio playback failures
- [x] Added test playback of sounds during initialization to ensure loading
