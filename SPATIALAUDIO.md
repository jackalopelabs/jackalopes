# Spatial Audio Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement spatial audio so players can hear each other's actions in 3D space.

## To-Do List

- [x] Fix Safari audio compatibility by adding MP3 alternatives for OGG files
- [ ] Create remote player audio component to handle sounds from other players
- [ ] Add audio mute controls to UI for testing with multiple browsers
- [ ] Implement audio position sync via the network system
- [ ] Add event system to trigger remote player sounds (footsteps, shots, etc.)
- [ ] Add audio occlusion/obstruction for more realistic spatial audio
- [ ] Optimize audio performance with culling based on distance

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Create RemotePlayerAudio Component
- Create a new component for remote player audio handling
- Add support for different audio types (footsteps, weapon sounds)
- Implement 3D spatial positioning

### 2. Implement Audio Mute Controls
- Add mute button to main UI
- Create global audio settings with mute option
- Save mute preference to localStorage
- Add individual volume controls for different sound categories

### 3. Network System Integration
- Extend existing network events to include audio triggers
- Send position data along with audio events
- Add timestamp for proper synchronization
- Implement latency compensation

### 4. Audio Event System
- Create event emitter/listener for audio events
- Add distinct event types for different sounds
- Implement throttling to prevent audio spam
- Add distance-based culling to save resources

### 5. Testing and Optimization
- Test with multiple browsers
- Measure performance impact
- Optimize buffer usage and audio loading
- Add audio pooling for frequently used sounds
